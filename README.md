# Sales-analysis
### Set Up, Prepare:
In this project, i use Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.
The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product types, cost, purchase address, and so forth.
All the data of 12 months: 

### Tasks and questions:
1) Cleaning Data:
   +) Drop Nan values from DataFrame
   +) Removing rows based on conditions
   +) Change the data type of columns
2) Data exploration:
   +) Q1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
   +) Q2: What city sold the most product?
   +) Q3:What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying product?
   +) Q4: What products are most often sold together?
   +) Q5: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

#### To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
+) _Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)_
+) _Adding columns_
+) _Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)_
+) _Using the .apply() method_
+) _Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis_
+) _Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results_
+) _Labeling our graphs_
